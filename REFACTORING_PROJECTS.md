# Refactoring

Useful refactoring projects. Please feel free to pick up any of these.


## Documentation updates

* Improved "how to write a provider" docs. The process for creating a DNS or Registrar provider could be improved. We should provide templates to copy instead of asking people to find a similar provider.  The doc should start by creating a generic provider, then add features and options over time.  The first thing should test credentials and nothing else.  Then add a registrar (if needed) and then the "preview" functionality, then "push".

## Rewrites needed

* Rework how metadata is passed to providers and how provider state is owned.
  Consider an explicit split between state specific to a `credEntry` (such as
  account-wide caches and rate limiters) and state specific to a
  `(domain, credEntry)` (such as domain-specific configuration). Revisit client
  initialization and reuse as part of that design. Also consider a tiered
  metadata system with explicit inheritance and precedence rules, or providers
  implemented as external binaries that maintain their own state. Keep this as
  a separate future project with appropriate provider testing, rather than
  expanding the current configuration-syntax rollout.

* Future provider concurrency change: default to allowing concurrency and replace
  authored `CanConcur` declarations with `ConcurBroken: true` only for providers
  that cannot run concurrently. Derive the compatibility `CanConcur` capability
  as `!ConcurBroken`, and audit existing `Cannot`/`Unimplemented` notes to
  distinguish known limitations from untested providers. Implement in a separate PR.

* PTR() "magic" should be reworked as a builder called PTR(). It will be much more
cleaner and more testable. Plus it will consolidate the code into one place instead
of being some in LabelFromDnsconfigjs() and other places.

* PopulateNamesFromRaw() and MakeDomainNameVarieties() seem like a silly design.  Maybe move them to pkg/nameutil, or maybe models (since that's where makeLabelNameUnicode() is)

* All the LOC() builders should be in Go, not helpers.js.

* There are multiple ways that code strips the trailing dot from a domain name.  Benchmark a few and standardize on the fastest. In pkg/nameutil. Possibly have one that is extra fast but panics if there is no "." at the end.

* pkg/normalize/validate.go has half of the Transform code, the other half is in pkg/transform.  An easy thing would be to move the part of pkg/normalize/validate.go and validate_test.go into pkg/normalize/transform{,_test}.go.  The more difficult thing would be to move all or most of the code to pkg/transform.

* models/record.go FixPostion has an easy TODO.

* models/t_txt.go has an some easy FIXMEs.

## Bad decisions to reverse

* Providers, not Registrars + DNS Service Providers.  It should be possible to make a PROVIDER() function that returns
something that is both a Reg and a DSP.

* External providers: It should be possible to add a provider without updating the source code to "dnscontrol". Teraform does it, why can't we?

* mustbe.TargetHost() accepts "." as a special flag. This can probably be replaced by nrc.Flags{}

* models.SetLabel() should be removed (it's only used in a few places) or enhanced to also create the .NameUnicode/.NameFQDNUnicode fields. Then de-duplicate the code that does this for NewRecordConfig().

* deSEC: BUG: It mutates RecordConfigs, which will create problems if the same zone is sent to multiple providers.


## Actual new features:

* Handle "unknown types". dnsv2 has a way to managing unknown types. Investigate it and replace the half-written version (see rc.UnknownTypeName)

* pkg/diff2/analyze.go: Smarter diffs. Diffs could just show which fields changed. For example, if just the preference of an MX record changes, show "old -> new" just for the priority.
